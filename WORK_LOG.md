| October 25 | The 45 minutes in class |                                                                                              We spent this time trying to come up with a solution to the problem set. The best idea we came up with was to use a polynomial rolling hash with a small modulus to separate the keys into different arraylists stored in an array. Then, with the key, you could iterate through the arraylist, with each index storing both the key and the value and then, when you reach the desired key, return the correct value. We also thought about speeding this process up by hashing the keys with a larger modulus within each array list, possibly speeding up comparisons. |

I finished writing the initial code, but am running into an index out of bounds exception in all cases. |

I forgot to change the the .split() method in another place, and I had it set up to set new ArrayLists to indexes whenever encountered. |

I don't know what is causing the collisions, but I noticed they occur within all of the prineton.edu domains, so I think there is an issue regarding the hash function. |

I finished writing a draft of the code for build table, and will now move on to building a draft of the query method to be able to check if my code works. At the moment, I'm running into an issue with an infinite loop in the testProducts case. |
| November 5 |        9:35-9:55        |                                                                                                                                                          I spent this time debugging my solution and completing the query method. I finished both and the code runs without error in all cases. However, the code takes slightly too long in the testStocks() case, which I can't really figure out. It seems wierd that thi case would be so much longer than the others when it has practically the same length, my current guess is that the memory allocated for the previous test case slows it down significantly, but I will debug more and fix it next session. |
| November 6 |        6:15-6:45        | I spent this time trying to make my code faster. I started by rewriting the code to work out excessive checks (also to make it look better, I don't really like having the while (true) loop running everything). From there, I was still running into the issue with the final test case being too slow, so I looked for ways to speed it up. One way I found was to replace the if statements I was using to check if I went over the limit with try and catch blocks, because they make it so I don't have to actually check if the index has exceeded the length of the array. This sped up my code but not quite enough, I will keep looking for ways to speed up. |
