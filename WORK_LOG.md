| October 25 | The 45 minutes in class | We spent this time trying to come up with a solution to the problem set. The best idea we came up with was to use a polynomial rolling hash with a small modulus to separate the keys into different arraylists stored in an array. Then, with the key, you could iterate through the arraylist, with each index storing both the key and the value and then, when you reach the desired key, return the correct value. We also thought about speeding this process up by hashing the keys with a larger modulus within each array list, possibly speeding up comparisons. |

I finished writing the initial code, but am running into an index out of bounds exception in all cases. |

I forgot to change the the .split() method in another place, and I had it set up to set new ArrayLists to indexes whenever encountered. |

I don't know what is causing the collisions, but I noticed they occur within all of the prineton.edu domains, so I think there is an issue regarding the hash function. |
